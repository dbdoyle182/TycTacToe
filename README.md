# TycTacToe

A program that allows two users to play tic tac toe locally on their own machine. All logic is written in Python and is played in the terminal. My goal with this project was to cement my understanding of the differences of python syntax.

## Prerequsites

* This requires the user to have the most recent version of Python installed on their machine. It can either be through the Anaconda Navigator or through Python alone. I highly recommend installing Anaconda for a first time Python user as it comes with a lot of helpful tools out of the box.
